# Todo 
- [X] Basic functionality 
- [X] add a dark theme
- [X] theme toggle 
- [ ] responsive 
- [ ] custom timer sound
- [ ] better design
- [X] add local storage 
- [ ] add about/wiki page
- [ ] break mode*
- [ ] dashboard*
- [ ] rewards stuff* 
- [X] settings page

This is still in alpha stage so somethings like about page (needs some things to be added yet) and dashboard page wont work!.
