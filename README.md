# Todo 
- [X] Basic functionality 
- [X] add a dark theme
- [X] theme toggle 
- [ ] responsive 
- [ ] custom timer sound
- [ ] better design
- [X] add local storage 
- [ ] add about/wiki page
- [ ] break mode*
- [ ] add about page
- [ ] dashboard*
- [ ] rewards stuff* 
- [X] settings page 
- [X] add more themes


This is still in alpha stage so the themes might not look well ( except default light theme ) and dashboard/rewards wont work.
