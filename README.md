# Todo

- [x] Basic functionality
- [x] add a dark theme
- [x] theme toggle
- [ ] responsive
- [ ] custom timer sound
- [ ] better design
- [x] add local storage
- [ ] add about/wiki page
- [ ] break mode\*
- [ ] dashboard\*
- [ ] rewards stuff\*
- [x] settings page
- [x] add more themes

This is still in alpha stage so somethings like about page (needs some things to be added yet) and dashboard page wont work!.
